<strong>User Registration Add-On</strong> 1.4 |

> This plugin requires the <a href="http://www.gravityforms.com/">Gravity Forms plugin</a>. <strong>Don't use Gravity Forms? <a href="http://www.gravityforms.com/">Buy the plugin</a></strong> and start using this revolutionary plugin!

The [Gravity Forms](http://www.gravityforms.com/) developers don't focus on translating 
their plugin. Instead they concentrate on the core functionalities of the plugin itself. 
Therefore there are regular updates of the Gravity Forms plugin. However, after each 
automatic update, the manually placed Dutch translations are deleted. This plugin fixes 
that issue for all the Dutch WordPress and Gravity Forms users!


== Installation ==

Extract the zip file and just drop the contents in the wp-content/plugins/ directory of your 
WordPress installation and then activate the Plugin from Plugins page.
