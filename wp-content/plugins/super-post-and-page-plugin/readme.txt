Displays information from a single post or page inside a widget with various display options.

== Description ==

This plugin will enable the creation of widgets that can grab a single page or post and display information in various ways. This is a very handy plugin for those wanting more CMS functionality out of wordpress. Currently the plugin should be considered in beta. Please send your feedback my way.

Currently it's possible to select a post or page id from which to display a (custom) title, a thumbnail in a selected size before or after the text (using wp 2.9+ thumbnail features). You can provide a custom 'read more' link. You can display the excerpt, the full content, or a custom field. 

*warning : do not use this with anything lower than wordpress 2.9*

== Installation ==

1. Upload `plugin-name.php` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. In the 'Widgets' panel you will be able to add Super Page Widgets to your widget areas.
4. Configure the widget with the options available

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What can this plugin be used for? =

They are a replacement in situations where one would typically use text widgets. Text widgets are clunky, user unfriendly and you can't move them easily without losing content. If you want to display information in columns, sidebars or other widget areas you can manage the information through creating a page or post and grab the information from that page or post and pull it into the widget. With various options available you can quickly create cms type pages. 

= I don't see a 'read more' link? =

Check your widget settings and make sure you defined a 'more text'. This plugin bypasses the automatic 'more' text generated by wordpress (typically [...]) and uses the widget setting instead. 

misc.
This plugin can be greatly complimented by 'Widget Logic', the 'Front-end-editor plugin' and future versions of my very own splittesting plugin.
